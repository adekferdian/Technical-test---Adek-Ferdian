Test case number 2:

A. About the function: 1. Stack Usage: We use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. 2. Matching Brackets Object: This object (matchingBrackets) helps in quickly checking if a closing bracket matches the last opened bracket on the stack. 3. Iteration through Input: We iterate through each character in the input string.
-> If it's an opening bracket ((, {, [), we push it onto the stack.
-> If it's a closing bracket (), }, ]), we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack corresponds to the matching opening bracket. If not, the brackets are unbalanced. 4. Final Check: After iterating through the input, if the stack is empty, all brackets have been matched correctly ("YES"), otherwise, there are unmatched brackets ("NO").

B. Complexity Analysis: 1. Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once, and each stack operation (push and pop) is 𝑂(1) 2. Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛), in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets and stored in the stack.

C. Explanation of Complexity: 1. Time Complexity: The function iterates through the input string exactly once, making it linear with respect to the input size, 𝑂(𝑛). 2. Space Complexity: The space complexity is also linear, 𝑂(𝑛), because the stack can grow up to the size of the input string in the worst case, where all opening brackets are unmatched.
